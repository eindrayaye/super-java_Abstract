<Java Abstract>
  
  (1) Abstract Class
  
  Is a restricted class that cannot be used to create object. To access it, it must be inherited from another class.
  
  (2) Abstract Method
  
  Can only be used in an abstract class, and it doesn't have a body.
  
  * Any method which is only declared but not implemented is called abstract method.
  
  * These method must be implemented in the child class.
  
  * Any class which is including one or more abstract method must be declare as abstract.

  * You can not create object of abstract class but you can create "reference variable".
  
  * A child class must implement all the abstract methods. If child class does not provide body to any of the abstract methods, it will also become an abstract.
